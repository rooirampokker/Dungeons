Dungeons
=========

A javascript based random dungeon generator.

Allows the user to enter dungeon dimensions to generate a dungeon composed of ~140 different 90 x 90px tiles.

Now automatically includes randomly generated large chambers (3x3 tiles) when space allows.

Also includes a hero in the 140 x 140 tile set that can traverse the dungeon with WASD keys.

Debug Grid checkbox identifies the tiles that still need mapping. Moving into these tiles will result in a fatal error.

The images are not mine and was generated by Probono, Bogie and the other talented guys at the http://www.dundjinni.com/ forums.
