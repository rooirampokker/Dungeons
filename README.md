Dungeons
=========

A javascript based random dungeon generator.

Allows the user to enter dungeon dimensions to generate a dungeon composed of ~140 different 90 x 90px tiles.

Now automatically includes randomly generated large chambers (3x3 tiles) when space allows.

The images are not mine and was generated by Probono, Bogie and the other talented guys at the http://www.dundjinni.com/ forums.
